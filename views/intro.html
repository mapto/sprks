<h1>Your Company</h1>

<div class="description">
    <p>Global Sparks is an international energy company, currently headquartered in London, which has begun to expand its operations internationally. In line with this strategy it started buying local electricity suppliers in the US in the early 2000s, and built up a substantial group of companies, primarily located on the West Coast. This period of rapid expansion has left the company somewhat fragmented internally, and this has begun to cause problems in terms of both business and security. To deal with this issue it has been going through a process of consolidating its acquisitions into a single company. An unfortunate side effect of this process has been a recent wave of redundancies. Almost all IT Support staff have been dismissed, because Global Sparks decided to outsource this function to a company based in India.  A period of growth has followed the consolidation, and the company has started to hire again, but mostly in the form of contractors (staff on limited-term contracts, and without health and pension benefits).  Many of these contractors are former employees of the companies Global Sparks acquired, and who had been made redundant. You have been hired as part of this process as a permanent security manager, with a brief to ensure that the consolidated company has not inherited any security weaknesses from its disparate components. Immediately several issues have come to light, resulting from both the mergers and the fluid hiring situation.</p>
